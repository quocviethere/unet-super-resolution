# Super Resolution

 This project aims to implement a Unet-like model that performs the super resolution task of receiving an input image of 64x64 size and outputting an image of the same content with the size increases by 4 times (256x256). The dataset we use can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17NiVpVxpkvbc2WDvz1VP0sos6NdbPjLE/view?usp=sharing).
